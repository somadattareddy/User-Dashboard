## About the App

This App displays a paginated list of users (fetched from [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)), where each page contains displays a list of 5 users.

On clicking on a user, the user details, as well as their posts, are displayed. A feature to add a post by that user allows the user to post (However, this functionality doesn't function properly as a Placeholder API is used for this app).
